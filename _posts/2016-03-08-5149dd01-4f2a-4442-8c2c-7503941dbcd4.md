The Chinese **Shar****-Pei **is a unique and intelligent **dog **most often recognized for its wrinkles. Initially developed as a Chinese farm and hunting and later fighting **dog**

The breed does well today in obedience, agility, herding and tracking, with skills that would have been needed on the farm.
